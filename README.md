# DomainDriven.Framework

This project makes use of the DDD framework used by **Vaughn Vernon** in his [**insert name here**] book [**link to book**]. It includes code from [**Lokad**](https://github.com/Lokad) that was released under the [**insert license here**].

The aim of this repo is to create NuGet packages that I can use among various projects. These NuGet packages can be obtained through

- [*for the Standard package, which is interfaces only*]
- [*for the implmentations by Vaughn Vernon*]

For an alternative, see the [AzureEventStore](https://github.com/Lokad/AzureEventStore) repo by [Lokad](https://github.com/Lokad) which provides an Azure Blob Storage approach.
